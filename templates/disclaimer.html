	This project was developed for the Course  "Introduction to Programming" as part of the Masters program at Nova SBE.
	<p>
	A simple user interface was developed to make the application interactive and easy to use for users who wish to know the chances of their application to an university in the U.S. being accepted.
	</p>
	The Logistic regression model has an accuracy of 65.87% and we recognize that there are many other factors that may influence admission.
	<p>
    Even though we collect personal information in the form of the content that the users choose to submit during their use of our Site, we will not share it with third-parties.
    </p>
	In future, more data related to additional universities and courses can be added as well as additional Machine Learning Models can be used.
	<p/>
	No matter what the outcome of your prediction was, we encourage everyone to still move forward with their applications!
